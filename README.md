# Public Policy Document

Welcome to the **Public Policy Document**, a repository of governance proposals written by and for **We The People**. This digital library is designed to promote transparency, accountability, and public engagement by providing detailed insights into policy development and legislative proposals at every level of governance. Here, you will find organized and searchable documents, summaries, cross-referenced topcs, and updates on policies that we believe should shape our society. Whether you are a researcher, policymaker, or engaged citizen, this repository ensures equitable access to critical information, empowering informed decisions and dialogue on matters of public interest.

## Structure: 
There are only two topics at the top of this document which cover all possible sub-topics. These are **Domestic Policy** and **Foreign Policy**. We understand that there are considerable sub-topics which cross from one to the other. These are addresses with links and references. No need to make governing a population more complicated than it already is. 

## Contributions: 
All humans are invited to contribute. If your contributions are well thought out, concise, and improve to the overall wellbeing of the populous, they will likely be accepted, promoted, and cannonized (for lack of a better term). If your contributions are knee-jerk reactions, represent extreme or biased viewpoints, or just plain stupid, they will die in /usr/sub.
