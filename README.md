Yep, this is the "README.md" file. Please read this. This document is an offer of employment which, if done well enough as a team, could lead to you, Dear Reader, to a significant amount of money, earned through cost plus effort. 

# THE BIRTH OF A NATION
My first comment on this doc was something like "A README is born" or some such. That reminded me of the ancient film titled "The Birth Of A Nation". It was about racism, and the KKK, and some truths, and some truths so true that we must call them false because our minds can't comprehend. At least that's the only excuse I can find for racism. This is a Declaration. A Declaration that the Great Grandparents of racism be investigated and systematically removed from our psyche forever. Willingly if we can, and I believe that the lowest of us is still high enough to know that we can go willingly. We will go wilingly, and where we get stuck, or lost, or more informed, we are gently yet firmly apply pressure in the direction of good without pissing off bad to such a degree that He takes revenge. 

Better still. We codify that next. 

First Order: The root of hate will be the single causality of our existances expiration, and we must do everything within our powers to see that we are on the side of good. 

Second Order: We have a fundamental need to support those who cannot support themselves.
